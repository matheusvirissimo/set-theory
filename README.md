# set-theory
A set theory program in C with a simple menu and a few other operations.

# more details about it
This program are fully builded in C language - both functions and menu. It was originally made for a college work at SÃ£o Paulo State University - UNESP -  for the discipline: "Algorithms and Programming Techniques II". The code will make the union, intersection and difference between two sets. In addition, the program will also see if: there's a dupplicate numbers (and how many times it appears) in both sets, as well as verifying whether a certain number belongs to either of the sets. 
Is also important to say: the program is ALL in Brazilian Portuguese.
